things to do:


- import and use properties.json data from local
- change fetch api to load the data (from backend to local)
- implement on data filter search for properties

- export properties_images, reviews collections to show the details
- pricing, checkin and checkout time (split time and mins properly) (add backend check as well)
- Avg Rating on Top and on Cards as well

- remove login details and set the jwt token at start  ?? (need to check on how to implement this)
